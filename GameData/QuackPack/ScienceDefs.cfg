		CindFlyingLowMidlands = Cind has an atmosphere unlike any other in the system, made up of many elements commonly thought of as solids.
		CindFlyingLowHighlands = Metal vapor levels are much lower here, as it condenses out onto the ground.
		CindFlyingLowPeaks = Highly elevated levels of Argon indicate that Cind once had a much thicker atmosphere than it now does.
		CindFlyingLowGreatImpactBasin = Metal vapor levels are much lower here, as it condenses out onto the ground.
		CindFlyingLowTwinCraters = The atmosphere here is somewhat denser and cooler than the full day side, but is it the same as the other twin?
		CindFlyingLowDarksideCrater = Metal vapor levels are much lower here, though there is plenty of sulfur to go around.
		CindFlyingLowCraters = Cind has an atmosphere unlike any other in the system, made up of many elements commonly thought of as solids.
		CindFlyingLowTwilightPlain = As you cross the terminator line, temperature continues to fall and density rises, and the metal content begins dropping.

		CindFlyingHighSubsolarMagmaOcean = There is still a minor level of metal enrichment in the atmosphere, but it is close to undetectable at this altitude.
		CindFlyingHighDarksideSea = If Cind ever had any water, it is long gone now, able to escape due to the high temperature.
		CindFlyingHighLavaLakes = Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are much lower than expected.
		CindFlyingHighLavaShores = Most of Cind's carbon dioxide was probably cracked by UV and the resultant individual atoms were able to escape.
